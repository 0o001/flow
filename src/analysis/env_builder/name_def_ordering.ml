    (* This analysis consumes variable defs and returns a map representing the variables that need to be
       resolved before we can resolve this def.

       Consider for example the program

         1: var x = 42;
         2: type T = typeof x;

       And let's specifically look at the def `TypeAlias(type T = typeof x)`, which will be one of the
       defs generated by the analysis in `name_def.ml`. Given this def, the question that this module
       answers is what variable definitions need to be resolved before the `TypeAlias` def itself can be resolved.

       We can see that the type alias depends on reading `x`, so in order to actually resolve the type alias, we
       first need to know the type of `x`. In order to do that, we need to have resolved the writes that (according
       to the name_resolver) reach this reference to `x`. That's what this analysis tells us--it will traverse the
       TypeAlias def, find the read of `x`, and add the writes to `x` that reach that read to the set of defs that need to
       be resolved before the type alias can be resolved. We'll ultimately use this to figure out the correct ordering
       of nodes.

       The actual output of this analysis is a map, whose keys are the locations of variables whose defs need to be resolved
       before this def can be. The values of this map are the locations within the def itself that led us to those variable definitions--
       in this case, the result will be [def of `x`] => [dereference of `x`]. This information is included for good error messages eventually,
       but the more important bit for the correctness of the analysis is the keys of the map--it may be easier to think of the map
       as a set and ignore the values.
